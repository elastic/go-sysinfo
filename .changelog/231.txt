```release-note:breaking-change
The FQDN is returned as is, it isn't lowercased anymore. This reverts https://github.com/elastic/go-sysinfo/pull/180.
Complying with ECS for `host.name` and `host.hostname` (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-host.html#field-host-name) should not be handled by go-sysinfo. The users of go-sysinfo should ensure compliance with ECS if necessary.
